Task 1

Task 2
This code asks the user to enter their first and last names, removes any extra spaces from the input, and then prints a personalized welcome message.

input("Enter your first name: ") prompts the user to type their first name.
.strip() removes any leading or trailing spaces from the input.
The same process is repeated for the last name.
The print statement combines the first and last names into a greeting message and displays it to the user.
